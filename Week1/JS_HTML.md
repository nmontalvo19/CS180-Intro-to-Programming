## 🖱 Example Activity — Display an Image on Button Click

In this demo, JavaScript dynamically creates an image and adds it to the page *when the user clicks a button.*

### **Purpose of This Exercise**
This activity teaches:

- How JavaScript interacts with the DOM
- How to create elements programmatically
- How user actions (like clicks) change the webpage without reloading
- How to update the UI using code instead of static HTML

---

### **📌 Example Workflow**

1. User clicks a button  
2. A function triggers (`showImage()`)
3. JavaScript creates an `<img>` element
4. The element is inserted into a container on the page

This helps you understand how websites handle interactivity beyond simple page loads.
