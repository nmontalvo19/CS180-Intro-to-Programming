# Grade Check Program — Explanation

This program takes five numerical grades from the user, calculates the total and average, and then assigns a letter grade based on the average.

## 🔹 What the Program Does

1. **Creates an array** to store 5 grades.
2. **Prompts the user** to enter each grade one at a time.
3. **Adds all grades together** to compute the total.
4. **Calculates the average** by dividing the total by 5.
5. **Outputs** both the total and formatted average.
6. **Determines the letter grade** using conditional statements:
   - 90+ → A  
   - 80–89 → B  
   - 70–79 → C  
   - 60–69 → D  
   - Below 60 → F

## 🔹 Key Concepts Used

- **Arrays** (`float grades[5]`)
- **Loops** to input values and calculate totals
- **Arithmetic operations** to compute averages
- **Conditional logic** (`if`, `else if`, `else`)
- **Mixed output formats** (`cout` + `printf`)

## 🧠 Purpose

This program helps practice:
- Handling multiple inputs with arrays
- Summation and averaging in C++
- Basic grading logic based on numeric thresholds
