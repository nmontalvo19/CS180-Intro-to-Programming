# JavaScript Practice Project Overview

This project contains multiple small web programs designed to help students learn core JavaScript concepts through interactive examples. Each page includes a button that triggers a JavaScript function, allowing users to input values and see immediate results.

## 🔹 What This Project Teaches

- How to use **arrays** and access values by index  
- How to **manipulate text** using built-in string methods  
- How to **evaluate conditions** using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements  
- How to **use switch statements** for multiple case outcomes  
- How to work with **loops**: `for`, `while`, and `do while`

## 🔹 Pages Included in This Project

| File | Purpose | Main Concept |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Arrays & String Manipulation** | Converts numbers to colors and edits sentences | Arrays + String Methods |
| **Day Checker** | Responds based on the day of the week | Switch Statements |
| **Grade Evaluator** | Displays a letter grade based on numeric input | Conditional Logic |
| **LoopyDLoop (Loop Examples)** | Counts numbers, checks passwords, and validates inputs | For, While, Do-While Loops |

## 🔹 Overall Goal

The goal of this project is to give students hands-on practice writing interactive JavaScript functions. Instead of passively reading examples, students click buttons, enter values, and see how logic, loops, and data structures behave in real time.

This provides a foundation for future topics such as:

- Form validation
- Data processing
- Web applications
- Dynamic UI behavior

## 🧠 Summary

This project brings together fundamental programming concepts in small, simple examples that help beginners learn how JavaScript interacts with users, processes input, and produces output on a webpage.
